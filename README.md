# Gym Hero :weight_lifting: :weight_lifting_woman:

A website about a gym called "Gym Hero", which showcases their work and their blog posts. :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

I love exercising in my spare time, so I thought why not make a website about a gym. The color theme is dark gray, blue and white, which is perfect for a gym. The pictures in the web page were important, because it attracts the person to visit this gym. :paintbrush:

## What I learned :brain:

- To combine colors and images so they fit well together
- The `flexbox` properties
- Heavily focused on creating lots of different `transitions` and working with the `transform` property.
- How to creat a pricing table (Membership Packages)
